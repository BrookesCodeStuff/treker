# Treker

## Description

Treker is an application designed for people who are looking to travel abroad. It provides the user with the current currency exchange rate at a one-to-one exchange and guidebooks relevant to their destination. Users can save any guidebooks that they like.

Our motivation was to fill a niche for overseas travelers who are looking to plan their trip beyond just hotels, flights, and rental cars. Travelers need to visit multiple sites to get the currency exchange and look for guidebooks, and we wanted to be able to find all of that information in one place.
